# Screen-Control-Using-Hand-Gestures
Human Machine Interface is a system comprising of hardware and software that helps  in communicating and exchanging information between the user and the machine. We normally take use of LEDs, Switches, Touch Screens and LCD Displays as a part of  HMI devices. Another way to communicate with machines like Robots or Computers  is with the help of Hand Movements. Instead of using keyboard or mouse we can use our hand gestures to control certain  functions of a computer like forward/rewind a video, increase/decrease the volume  of a video, scroll up/down through the web pages and many more. The objective of the project is a simple Arduino based hand gesture controlling where  you can control functions of your web browser like switching between tabs, scrolling  up and down in web pages, shift between tasks (applications), changing the songs in  Spotify, play or pause a video and increase or decrease the volume or mute the video  (in VLC Player and YouTube) with the help of hand gestures.
